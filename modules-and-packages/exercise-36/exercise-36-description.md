# Exercise 36 : Sales tax

## For this excercise

Write a function, __flatten__, that takes a list of lists (just one element deep)
and returns a flat, one-dimentional version of the list.


Sales tax on purchases in Freedonia depends on where the purchase was made, as well as the time of the purchase.
Fredonia has four provinces, each of which charges its own percentage of tax:
* Chico: 50%
* Groucho: 70%
* Harpo: 50%
* Zeppo; 40%
