EXERCISE 2 Summing numbers
We need to re-implement the sum (http://mng.bz/MdW2) function
that comes with Python. That function takes a sequence of numbers and returns the
sum of those numbers. So if you were to invoke sum([1,2,3]) , the result would be 6.

The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the
built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it
should take a variable number of arguments.
