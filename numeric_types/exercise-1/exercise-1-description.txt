Exercise #1 - Number guessing game
For this exercise:
    Write a function ( guessing_game ) that takes no arguments.
    When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
    Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.
    Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:
        – Too high
        – Too low
        – Just right
    If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. 
        Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
    The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.

This program is a simple application of the comparison operators ( == , < ,
and > ) to a number, such that a user can guess the random integer that the computer
has chosen.

First and foremost, we use the random module to generate a random number. After
importing random , we can then invoke random.randint , which takes two parameters,
returning a random integer. In general, the random module is a useful tool whenever
you need to choose a random value.
