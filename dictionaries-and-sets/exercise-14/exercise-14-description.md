# Exercise 14 : Restaurant

## For this excercise
Create a constant dict, called MENU, representing the possible items you can order
at a restaurant. The keys will be strings, and the values will be prices.
Then write a function, _restaurant_, that asks the user to enter an order:
* If the user enters the name of a dish on the menu, the program prints the price
and the running total. It then asks the user again for their order.
* If the user enters the name of a dish not on the menu, the program scolds the
user (mildly). It then asks the user again for their order.
* If the user enters an empty string, the program stops prompting and prints the
total amount.
