# Exercise 48 : All lines, all files

## For this excercise

* Create a generator function, that will take a directory name as an argument. 
* With each iteration, the generator function should return a single string, representing one line from one file in that directory.
    * Thus, if the directory contains five files, and each file contains 10 lines, the generator will return a total of 50 strings- each of the lines from file 0, then each of the lines from file 1, then each of the lines from file 2, until it gets through all of the lines from file 4
