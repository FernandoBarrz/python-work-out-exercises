# Exercise 46 : MyEnumerate

## For this excercise

* Create your own _MyEnumerate_ class, such that someone can use it instead of _enumerate_. It will need to return a tuple with each iteration, with the first element in the tuple being the index (starting with 0) and the second element being the current element from the underlying data structure.
* Trying to use _MyEnumerate_ with a noniterable argument will result in an error.
