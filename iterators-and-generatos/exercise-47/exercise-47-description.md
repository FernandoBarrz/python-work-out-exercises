# Exercise 47 : Circle

## For this excercise

* Define a class, _Circle_, that takes two arguments when defined: a sequence and a number.
* The idea is that the object will then return elements the defined number of times.
    * If the number is greater than the number of elements, then the sequence repeats as necessary.
* Define the class such that it uses a helper (which I call CircleIterator).

Here's an exampe:

```python
c = Circle('abc', 5)
print(list(c)) # Prints a. b. c. a. b
```
