## For this excercise

* Write a generator function whose argument must be iterable. With each iteration, the generator will return a two-element tuple.
    * The first element in the tuple will be an integer indicating how many seconds have passed since the previous iteration.
    * The tuple's second argument will be the next item from the passed argument.
