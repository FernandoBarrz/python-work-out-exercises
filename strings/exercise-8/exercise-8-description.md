# Exercise 7 : Sorting a string

## For this excercise
Write a function (strsort), that takes a single string as its input and returns a string.
The returned string should contain the same characters as the input, except that its characters should be sorted in order, from the lowest Unicode value to the highest Unico0de value.
* For example, the result of invoking strsort('cba') will be the string "abc".
