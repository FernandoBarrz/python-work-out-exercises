# Exercise 7 : Ubbi Dubbi

Based on the popular game known as: __Ubbi Dubbi__ 

The rules for Ubbi Dubbi translation are:

* In UD, every vowel (a, e, i, o or u) is prefaced with "ub".
    * Thus "milk" becomes "mubilk" (m-ub-ilk) and "program" becomes (prub-ogrub-am). 

## For this excercise
Write a function (ubbi_dubbi) that takes a (word) string as an argument. 
The function returns a string, the word's translation into UB.
