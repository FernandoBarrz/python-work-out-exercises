# Exercise 38 : Ice cream scoop

## For this excercise

Define a class, __Scoop__, that represents a single scoop of ice cream.
Each scoop should have:
* A single attribute (flavor).
    * A string that can be initialized when creating the instance of Scoop.
Once created, write a function (create_scoops) that creates three instances of the Scoop class, each of which has a different flavor.
* Put these three instances into a list called scoops.
Finally iterate over the scoops list, printing the flavor of each scoop of ice cream created.
