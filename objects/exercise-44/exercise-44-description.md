# Exercise 44 : Cages

Given the Animal class created in the last exercise:

## For this excercise
* Create a __Cage__ class, into which you can put one or more animals, as follows:

```python
c1 = Cage(1)
c1.add_animals(qold, sheep)

c2 = Cage(2)
c2.add_animals(snake, parrot)
```
* A new Cage instance will have a unique ID number.
Define a '_ _ repr _ _' method so that printing a cage prints not just the cage ID, but also the animals it contains.
