# Exercise 43 : Animals

__CONTEXT__: We will repr4esent animals of a zoo as Python objects, with each species defined as a distinct class.
* All objects of a particular class will have the same species and number of legs, but the color will vary from one instance to another.
* It will be possible to get information about the animal back from the object by retrieving its attributes.
* If the instance (Animal) is converted to string (using str or print). A string combining all of its attributes will returned

## For this excercise
* Assume that the Zoo contains four different types of animals:
    1. sheep.
    2. wolves.
    3. snakes.
    4. parrots.
* Create classes for each of these types, such that we can print each of them and get a report on their color, species, and number of legs.
