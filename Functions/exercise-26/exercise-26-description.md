# Exercise 26 : Prefix notation calculator

## For this excercise

Write a function, _calc_, that expects a single argument- a string containing a simple
math expression in prefix notation- with an operator and two numbers.
The program will parse the input and produce the appropiate output.
* Handle the six basic arithmetic operations: +-*/, modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).
* Implement each operation in different function definition
* Do not use an IF statement to decide which function should be run.
* Use the operator module.
