# Exercise 9 : First-last

## For this excercise
Write a function (firstlast), that takes a sequence (string, list, or tuple) and returns the first and last elements of that sequence, in a two-element sequence of the same type.
So firstlast('abc') will return the striing 'ac', while firstlast([1, 2, 3, 4]) will return the list [1, 4].


### Note:

> When you retrieve a slice from an object x, you get back a new object of the same type as x. But if you retrieve an individual element from x, you'll get whatever was stored in x - which may be the same type as x, but you can't be sure.
