# Exercise 20 : Word Count

## For this excercise
Write a function _wordcount_ that mimics the wc _Unix command_
The function will take a filename as input and will print four lines of output:
1. Number of characters (including whitespace)
2. Number of words (separated by whitespace)
3. Number of lines
4. Number of unique words (__case sensitive__, so "NO" is different from "no")
