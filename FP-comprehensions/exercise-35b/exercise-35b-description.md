# Exercise 35b : Gematria, part 2

## For this excercise

Given the function from the last exercise, find words with the same gematria value.
If two words have the same gematria value, then they're linked in some way.
For this exercise, write __two__ functions:
1. gematria_for: Which takes a single word (string) as an argument and returns the gematria score for that word.
2. gematria_equal_words: Which takes a single word and returns a list of those dict words whose gematria scores match the current word's score.
